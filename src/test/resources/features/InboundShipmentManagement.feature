@WarehouseManagement @InboundOperations
Feature: Inbound Shipment Management
  As a warehouse operator
  I want to manage inbound shipments from pre-receiving to receipt generation
  So that I can efficiently process incoming inventory with proper tracking and documentation

  Background:
    Given the warehouse management system is initialized
    And I am logged into the warehouse system as "warehouse_operator"
